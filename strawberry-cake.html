<p id="ingredients"><b>Here are the ingredients you'll need:</b></p>
			<p id="ingredients">4 Large Eggs</p>
			<p id="ingredients">60g Whole milk (¼ cup)</p>
			<p id="ingredients">45ml Vegetable oil (3 tbsp)</p>
			<p id="ingredients">55g Cornstarch (⅓ cup 2 tbsp)</p>
			<p id="ingredients">55g All-purpose flour (⅓ cup 2 tbsp)</p>
 			<p id="ingredients">250g Granulated sugar (1 cup)</p>
			<p id="ingredients">80ml Water (⅓ cup)</p>
			<p id="ingredients">600ml Whipped Cream (2 ½ cups)</p>
			<p id="ingredients">1 tsp Vanilla extract</p>
			<p id="ingredients">370g Strawberries (13oz)</p>
			<p id="hidden-text">Preheat the oven to 140°C fan forced/ 150°C convection. Line the bottom of an 8-inch cake tin with parchment paper. In a medium-sized bowl whisk the egg yolks, mil, and oil. Sift the flour into the egg yolk mixture and mix until combined. In another bowl with an electric whisk, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites with sugar until stiff peaks. Add ⅓ of the meringue into the egg yolk mixture and mix until smooth. Transfer the lightened egg yolk mixture to the remaining meringue and fold carefully until just combined. Transfer the batter to the cake tin. Place the cake tin in a water bath (a tray/tin of boiling water) and bake for 70 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool completely. Once cooled run a knife around the edge of the cake tin and invert the pan. Wrap in cling wrap and place in the fridge until assembly. Whip the cream with an electric whisk and slowly stream the sugar in. Beat until stiff peaks. Combine the sugar and water in a small bowl and microwave for 30 seconds until melted, cool. Slice half the punnet of strawberries. Slice the cooled cake into three layers. Lay one layer of cake down and brush with the sugar syrup. Spread on a layer of cream, a layer of strawberries and then cover with another layer of cream, repeat. Place the last layer of sponge on top and give the cake a thin crumb coat before icing the entire cake with cream. Place star tip into a piping bag and fill it with the remaining cream. Pipe a border around the edge of the cake and decorate with the remaining strawberries.</p>
